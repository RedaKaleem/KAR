### A Research-Oriented Emotionally Aware Conversational AI with Personality and Long-Term Memory

</div>

---

## Abstract

Sael is a research-focused project that explores how conversational AI systems can move beyond purely informational responses toward **emotionally aware, personality-consistent, and memory-driven interactions**.

The goal of this project is to investigate how **emotion modeling, long-term memory, and personality constraints** can be integrated into a large language model based system to create more **human-like, coherent, and emotionally appropriate conversations** over long time spans.

---

## Motivation

Most modern conversational AI systems are optimized for:

- Answering questions  
- Following instructions  
- Producing correct information  

However, they are **not designed to maintain emotional continuity, personality consistency, or long-term relational context**.

Human conversation is not only about information exchange — it is also about:

- Emotion  
- Tone  
- Memory  
- Relationship continuity  

Sael is an attempt to study and prototype systems that operate in this space.

## Research Objectives

This project aims to explore:

- How can an AI system **model and respond to user emotions** in a consistent way?
- How can **long-term and short-term memory** be structured for conversational continuity?
- How can a **stable personality layer** be imposed on top of a generative model?
- How can responses be shaped not only by *what* is said, but by **how it should be said**?

## Core Ideas

-  **Emotion-Aware Response Generation**  
-  **Hybrid Memory System (Short-term + Long-term)**  
-  **Personality-Constrained Decoding Layer**  
-  **Paralinguistic Expression (tone, pacing, softness, etc.)**  
-  **Long-Horizon Conversational Consistency**
